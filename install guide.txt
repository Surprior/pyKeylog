After atempting for a few days, these are the steps that worked for me to get pyHooks working on Windows 10:

Uninstall any other verson of pyHook

Download pyHook_py3k:
	https://github.com/Answeror/pyhook_py3k

Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0:
	http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools

Update setuptools:
	pip install --upgrade setuptools

Download and install swig.exe:
	http://www.swig.org/download.html

Install pyHook_py3k:
	cd path-to-extracted-pyhook_py3k-master
	python3 setup.py build_ext --swig=path-to-swig.exe
	pip install .

Combine HookManager.py og cpyHook.py in site-packages\pyHook:
	See: HookManager.py.MODIFIED
	More or less copied the content of cpyHook.py into HookManager.py at the top, removed the import at the top of HookManager.py and "self." in some places
